# Contributing to the universe python package
üëç Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project üëç

This is the matter repositry storing the universe python package devloped by Python Pogrammer aka Hasan Akhtar (AkhHas2005)
You are allowed to contribute to this project but with certain restrictions
Of course, we must have guidelines to ensure everything on the repostiory is up-to-standard and easy for beginners to follow!
These are mostly guidelines and not rules, but please aim to follow as many of these as possible.

## What should I know before starting to contribute?

### Repository design
#### The repositry has a `main` directory and then 2 sub-directories
##### The sub-directory `Contributions` is where you can add your files
###### If any files are found anywhere else, they will be deleted, but a warning will be issued before that

### Programming Language and support
#### The sole programming language in this project is python so don't be putting any file other than `.py` files into the repository
##### The only programming paradigm supported is OOP but if you don't adhere to this, it can be adjusted by the owner
###### Support for this package will be sorted out in the coming weeks and months

### Restrictions
##### These are the following restrictions for users contributing to this project
- All contributing files MUST be python files (`.py` files)
- All contributing files MUST be in the `Contributions` sub-directory (folder)
- All contributing files MUST be in the OOP format and contain only 1 Class with as many methods as you like
- No contributions should be placed in any other folder or in any other format

# How can I contribute?

## File format for contributions
#### Files should use the OOP paradigm so basically where you have a class and all methods and attributes are contained within that class
##### Optionally you can add some code for if the file is run directly, for more info click [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-name-main-python-example/)
##### You can use the code in the `CompSci` folder for inspiration and to see the formatting

## Type of file accepted
#### The type of file should strictly be a python file with extension `.py`
##### Any other files will not be accepted unless they are supplementary to the python file e.g. a text file storing input data

## Ability to branch files
#### All contributions should be made on the `contributions` branch, then they will be pulled over to the `main` branch by the owner
##### A example of how to publish to the `contributions` branch rather than the `main` one is below:
First go to the `code` page of the repository and click where it says `main` in the top left corner, just underneath the title of the repository

Then click on the bit that says `contributions` underneath main in the `branches` section

Next, when you add a file, it should be on the `contributions` branch, rather than the `main` branch
###### Alternatively, you can create a new branch when uploading files, here's how:

Then, when you've switched branches, you can upload your files to the new branch
